# Master Thesis Preview - Neural Style Transfer in 3D

This repo is for Mengdi's master thesis, topic in neural style transfer in 3D. The goal of this theis project is to transfer style from 2D image onto 3D mesh such that the mesh is reshaped and textured. 

The project is currently about 80% in progress and will be finished by May 5th, 2022. With the end of this thesis project, Mengdi's master study at ETHZ reaches its end.

For privacy and anti-plagiarism, the source code and the report will not be uploaded on GitHub before Mengdi's graduation from ETHZ. Instead, a byproduct of the project - extended 2D neural style transfer, is given in Python notebook. The notebook can be directly run on Google Colab.

In case you need the source code or the report of this project, please contact Mengdi personally.
